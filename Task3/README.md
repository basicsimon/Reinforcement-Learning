# Objective:

Explore the Frozen Lake environment using Q-Learning with hyperparameter tuning.

Task

Use the provided Python file to develop a Q-Learning solution for the Frozen Lake environment.
Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve the agent’s learning process.
Try the 8x8 Frozen Lake map and compare the agent’s performance with the smaller default map?
Code Snippet (5–10 lines)

Run the Frozen Lake environment with your chosen hyperparameters.
Save the trained **Q-table** in Pickle format.
Record a short video showing the evaluation of your model on both the default and larger map. (Ensure the video is recorded in full-screen mode so that the main part of your code is visible during the evaluation.)
