States/Observations: What does the agent “see”?
Actions: What can the agent do?
Rewards: How does the environment reward or penalize the agent?
Code Snippet (5–10 lines)

Create and reset the environment.
Print out the observation_space and action_space.
Run a short loop (e.g., 5 steps) taking random actions and print the resulting observations and rewards.
